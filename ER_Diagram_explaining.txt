About the 'ER_Diagram'(as you can see in the homonym file) :

We have 4 entities:		1)Movies
				2)People 
				3)Roles 
				4)Genre

There are 2 relationships: 	1)film_people (connecting people with movies and roles)
				2)film_genre  (connecting movies with genre)

Each entity has its own attributes(oval shapes).
This also applies to each relationship, that 'adopts' the attributes 
from its connecting entities.
